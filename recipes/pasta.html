        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>15 minutes prep, 25 minutes cook and 4 servings</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1kg kent pumpkin, deseeded, peeled, cut into 2.5cm pieces</li>

                <li>Add the pesto to the pasta and toss until coated. Add the pumpkin and bason and toss until well combined. Divide among serving bowls and sprinkle with parmesan. Serve immediately.</li>
